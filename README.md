# ML

We want to optimize the pastry inventory. Therefore we want to:
- know what amount of pastry is needed/consumed on a given day
- how what are possible outliers (and their possible explanations) (e.g., a lot of pastry consumption on casual Friday?)
- the provided data, as visible, is a time-series of one month (april 2019)(edited)
